#  - use 2D noise to make 2D array of 0s (no tile) and 1s (has tile, active region).
#    - input a certain bias for the noise gneration and bias the nosie towards 1s.
#    - if not all 1s are connected, grow disconnected spots of 1s until connected.
#  - equally spread center of field_groups within the active region.
#    - store the centers in group_data.
#  - create a variance value within which to assign grow rates.
#  - assign different grow rates to each field_group.
#  - grow field_group around center until every field group has at least one neihbor.
#    - take turns when growing centers, such that all field groups grow almost equally.
